List of features we could extract and implement into other programs:
	Spell-check by Porter Stemmer can be repeatedly used in another context.
	The snippet of code used to check synonyms using WordNet can be used to refine speech recognition and making responses.
	The GUI can be used as a general chat interface.
	State variables can be used similarly to a large switch with clear-cut conditions and used in conjunction with other conditions. (e.g. state == 5 && item.equals(“boot”))
	This I/O structure can be implemented in many other places.
